SeqAn - The Library for Sequence Analysis

SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures
for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data. Our library
applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality,
extensibility, and integration with other libraries.

This target installs the library into seqan:lib and the following applications:

- alf
- dfi
- razers
- razers3
