(*
We build and install each sub-project individually because:

- The bug reported [here](https://github.com/ncbi/ngs/issues/1), which
  requires ngs-sdk to be done manually first.

- We're not yet building all sub-projects.

The default `make install` installs to locations that violate opam's
directory structure. Usually this is resolved by providing a .install
file, but that is difficult here since the set of files installed is
large. Instead we use a trick; we set the prefix to `_install`, and then
use some cp commands to move the files en masse to the desired
locations.
