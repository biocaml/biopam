HLA typing

We developed an in-silico method "Seq2HLA", written in python and R, which takes
standard RNA-Seq sequence reads in fastq format as input, uses a bowtie index
comprising all HLA alleles and outputs the most likely HLA class I and class II
genotypes (in 4 digit resolution), a p-value for each call, and the expression
of each class.

The package wraps the script into a standalone executable: seq2HLA.
